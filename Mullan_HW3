        x=0
        string = ''

            x=x+1

2. maximum in a list

3. Lengths of words

    for string in words:
        numberlist.append(len(words[x]))    #Places the len of the string in the list   
        x=x+1                               #Increase the counter to get the length of the next string
    return (numberlist)

4. Find longest word
def find_longest_word(words):           #words must be a list of strings in brackets
    longest = words[0]                  #assume the first one is the longest
    x=0                                 #Counter
    for string in words:
        if len(words[x])>len(longest):  #if the string that we are looking at is longer than the previous longest word,
            longest = words[x]          #It is the new longest word
        
        x=x+1                           #Increase the counter to check the next word in the list
                
    return len(longest)                 #Return the length of the longest word
